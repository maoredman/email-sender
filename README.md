# Automatic email sender

Code which sends email. Can also send emails "anonymously", but servers may still log your computer name and IP address--not a substitute for professional services.


To use: `python email-sender.py` or `python email-anonymous.py`


I learnt a lot about how emails are sent while working on this code!
